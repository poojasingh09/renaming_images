edits to make: 
make sure you change the path and out path and edit the image extension

what the code does:
this python script identifies fishec identity number in the photo and renames the photo using that number
it copies that file over so that the original images are not affected
when it cannot recognise a fishec code in the image, for whatever reason, it retains the original file name, so you will manually have to check these
make sure to double check the output!



Remember: always keep the original files.
